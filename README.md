# What is Meld?

Meld, simply put is a one stop shop to keep track of anything and everything relevant to me. This consists of tools and functions for goals like date-time since I've started working out or whether I've been keeping track of my habits.

# Motivation

From my perspective application like notion are too cumbersome and can become a time-sink i.e. time speeding to tinker vs productivity produced i felt was not worth it so creating an application
that was minimalistic was important for me.
